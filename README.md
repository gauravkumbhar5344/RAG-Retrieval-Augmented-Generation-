# RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-
This repository explores RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — a powerful method that combines retrieval-based search with generative models to provide more grounded and up-to-date responses. The goal of this project is to implement and compare different types of RAG pipelines, using various vector stores, retrievers, and LLMs.
